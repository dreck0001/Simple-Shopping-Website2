# Simple-Shopping-Website2
In this homework assignment, I improved the previous server-side application [Simple-Shopping-Website](https://github.com/dreck0001/Simple-Shopping-Website)
 by using the Spring framework. The application uses an HttpSession object to store and retrieve selected products for a user's shopping cart. Other improvements include the use of annotated controllers and IoC Dependency Injection.
